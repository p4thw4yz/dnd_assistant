  "notes": "These goblins are particularly aggressive, driven by a strange compulsion to hoard shiny objects. They are skilled at ambushing from the shadows and are easily distracted by food. The presence of the ancient elven ruins adds a layer of danger, as the magic emanating from them seems to pull these goblins towards the dark caves."
